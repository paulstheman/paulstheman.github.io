        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>My company is based on the belief that the customers' needs are of the utmost importance.
            I am committed to meeting those needs.  I am dedicated to handling every job, whether small or large,
            I love odd jobs, the sort of jobs that you don't have the time or expertise to do.
            If you have accumulated a list of small repair projects, I have experience that can guide you; Paul the handy man can help.</p>

        <p>I will perform high quality work with complete dedication and an eye for detail.
            I believe in giving my customers the best value possible and will be courteous and
            respectful of you and your home.  I understand that property maintenance can be
            expensive so I provide <a href="rates.html">competitive quotes</a> and give great value for money.</p>

        <p>I am proud of my work.  As a result, a high proportion of my business is from repeat customers and <a href="testimonials.html">recommendations</a>.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Experienced, Guaranteed, Reliable, Trustworthy.</strong></em></p>
